CLAUDE USAGE AND ATTRIBUTION

This repository grants explicit permission to contributors to use code generated by Anthropic Claude ("Claude") in pull requests and commits, subject to the following rules and guidance.

1. Attribution
- Any code, configuration, or documentation primarily authored by Claude must include a short attribution comment at the top of the file or the top of the contributed section. Example:

  // Portions of this file were generated with the assistance of Anthropic Claude (https://www.anthropic.com/)

2. Verification and Review
- Claude-generated code is allowed but must not be merged without a human review.
- Reviewers must: run the project tests, linting, and static analysis; check for security, performance, and license compatibility issues; and ensure the code meets the project's style and architectural guidelines.

3. Secrets and Credentials
- Never include secrets, credentials, or any private keys in prompts to Claude or in generated code.
- If Claude outputs values that look like secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords), treat them as sensitive and rotate/change them immediately; do not commit them.

4. Security Best Practices
- Run `detect-secrets` or equivalent before committing contributions that include generated code.
- Validate third-party imports suggested by Claude: pin versions, run vulnerability scans, and prefer well-known packages.

5. Licensing and Copyright
- Ensure any third-party code suggested or included by Claude is properly licensed for use. Do not assume generated code is free of licensing restrictionsâ€”confirm license compatibility for incorporated code.

6. Responsible Usage
- Use Claude to accelerate development and for assistance with boilerplate, refactorings, and suggestions. Always treat outputs as recommendations that require confirmation.

7. Contact
- If you are unsure about a generated contribution, raise it in the repository issues or contact repository maintainers.

For detailed guidance on working effectively with Claude on each request, see [WORKING_WITH_CLAUDE.md](docs/WORKING_WITH_CLAUDE.md).

This file may be updated by repository maintainers to refine policy or attribution requirements.

Note about Claude 3.7 in GitHub Copilot for Visual Studio
-------------------------------------------------------

As of 2025-09-12, Claude 3.7 is available as a model in GitHub Copilot for Visual Studio. Contributions produced via Copilot (including Copilot that uses Claude 3.7) are covered by this repository's policy: any generated code must follow the attribution, verification, secrets, licensing, and security guidelines in this document. When a contributor uses Copilot inside Visual Studio, they should:

- Add the attribution comment shown above where applicable.
- Run the same human review, tests, linters, and detect-secrets checks before merging.
- Treat Copilot outputs as suggestions that require confirmation and avoid pasting or committing any literal secrets suggested by the model.

If you want, maintainers can add an automated PR checklist or pre-commit hook to detect the attribution comment and enforce required checks.

Automated Enforcement
--------------------

This repository implements the following automated tools to help enforce Claude usage policy:

1. **PR Template with AI Checklist**: When creating a pull request, you'll see a dedicated "AI-Generated Code Checklist" section. Check off each item to confirm you've followed the policy.

2. **Pre-commit Hook for Attribution**: The repository includes a pre-commit hook that scans for signals of AI-generated code and reminds you to add attribution if it detects potential Claude-generated content without proper citation.

To use these tools:
- For PRs: Fill out the checklist items in the PR template when submitting your changes.
- For pre-commit: Run `pre-commit install` to set up the hooks, or if using the repo's `.venv`:
  ```
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pre-commit install
  ```
