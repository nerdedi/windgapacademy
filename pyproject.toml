# Project-level configuration for ruff linter
# This file is intentionally conservative: the O3DE test suite relies on
# runtime-provided modules and star-imports that ruff flags (e.g. F821,
# F403). We silence those codes for the test tree so automated lint runs
# across the workspace do not fail CI while keeping checks enabled for
# the rest of the repository.

 # Keep top-level config minimal; move lint-specific options to the
 # recommended subsection so newer versions of ruff don't warn.

# Active error classes to check. Kept intentionally broad for CI.

# Per-file ignores for the O3DE automated tests. These tests rely on
